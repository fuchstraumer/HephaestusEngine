HephaestusEngine Project Overview:
========================================================================

Rudimentary attempt at building a C++ based voxel engine, in the middle
of being rewritten to use Vulkan.


This project draws inspiration and code from several sources. I've drawn 
heavily from the following projects:

https://github.com/minetest/minetest

https://bitbucket.org/volumesoffun/polyvox/

https://github.com/fogleman/Craft

TODO:
========================================================================

- Finish up the Vulkan transition before adding more TODO tasks.
- Following above, add an actual GUI during transition (using ImGui)
