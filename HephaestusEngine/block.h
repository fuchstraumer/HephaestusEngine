	Type: Class. Object: Block.

	Methods: bool isActive, void setActive,blockType getType,void setType,void setupMesh, vector<blockVerts,blockFaces> getMesh

	This object represents the base block in the voxel engine. Its main attributes are "blockActive" and "blockType". blockActive states
	whether or not a block should exist in the overall world. blockType specifies the block's type and is used to fetch/set its rendering data.

	blockVerts and blockFaces are related to rendering. blockVerts is a vector containing sub-vectors (glm::vec3) for the position coordinates and
	the normal vectors. blockFaces is a vector of glm::vec3's acting as indices into the blockVerts vector. Each glm::vec3 contains the 3 vertices
	needed to draw a triangle, and each row contains two vec3s specifying one whole face. blockFaces is also ordered by face as such:
	face = vector<glm::vec3> blockFaces = vector<face>
	blockFaces = ( leftFace, rightFace, topFace, bottomFace, frontFace, backFace )

	Keeping track of these indices and what face is where is important for later functions used to optimize rendering, primarily by not rendering
	obscured triangles.
